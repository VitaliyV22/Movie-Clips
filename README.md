# Movie Clips

Movie Clips is a movie rating website I built for my portofolio. It uses the TMBD API to fetch data. You can search movies and shows based on different criteria and also add them to your favorites list.



## Demo
The project is hosted on AMS Amplify

DEMO: https://main.dw23q6nv8tu6w.amplifyapp.com/
## Features

- Search Bar
- Filtering between Popular, Now Playing and Top Rated
- Add to Favorite / Remove from Favorite
- API fetching from tmbd.org



## Lessons Learned

Building this project I learned how a web application is built using React JS, specifically the use of stats, routing, props and fetching data. A challenge I faced was how to create right components and share state between them so the process between switching pages was seamless. The use of the API was very intuitive thanks to the great documentation that you can find on tmbd.
